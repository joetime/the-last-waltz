There is a town in north Ontario,
D          A                 G
With dream comfort memory to spare,
D         A            G
and in my mind I still need a place to go,
D      A            G
All my changes were there,

D          A         G
Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
D      A    G
Yellow moon on the rise,
D         A       G
Big birds flying across the sky,
D        A          G
Throwing shadows on our eyes.

D         A             G
Helpless, helpless, hel helpless
D    A       G
Baby can you hear me now?
D              A          G
The chains are locked and tied across the door,
D     A         G 
Baby, sing with me some how.

Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
D      A    G
Yellow moon on the rise,
D         A       G
Big birds flying across the sky,
D        A          G
Throwing shadows on our eyes.

Helpless, helpless, hel helpless 3x
