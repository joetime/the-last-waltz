A
   She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
                      E     
Alone in the pale moonlight

Waiting for a man, a riverboat gambler
                        A
Said that he'd return tonight

They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
                       E
Loving the whole night through
                         
'Til the riverboat gambler went off to make a killing
                        A
And bring it on back to you.

   D          A
Evangeline, Evangeline
E                       A
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen
        E             A
That pulled her man away.

Bayou Sam, from the South Lousianne
Had gambling in his veins
Evangeline, from the Maritimes(*)
Was slowly going insane.

High on the top of Hickory Hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river the boat was a-sinking
She watched that queen go under
